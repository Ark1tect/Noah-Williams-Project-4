            <h3>Champlain Hudson <br>Power Express</h3>
            <p>
                The Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE) is an ambitious clean energy project that will bring
                hydropower
                generated in the province of Quebec down through Lake Champlain and the Hudson River valley to New York
                City. The total
                route will strech over 339 miles. <br><br>The project has recieved permits from New York State Public
                Service
                Commission, the United States Department of Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
                construction is now underway.<br><br>
                The line of travel shown on this map is an approximation based on docuemnts published by CHPE.

            <h3>Canadian Border</h3>

            <p>
                Electricity is generated by an extensive network of hydropower facilities in Canada, including both dams
                and constructed spillways. The electricity is then transmitted through high voltage direct current
                (HVDC) cables. These power lines enter the US under Lake Champlain and follow the waterway
                south. In total, 60% of the route will be through waterways and 40% will be buried lines.

            <h3>Putnam New York</h3>
            <p>
                In Putnam, the transmission lines will move from underwater to terrestrial. The terrestrial portions of
                the
                route will pass through 39 municipalities including New York City. CHPE estimates that the project will
                generate $1.4 billion for these municipalities in new tax reveneue over the first 25 years of its
                operation.

            <p>
                The transmission lines will enter the Hudson River in Alsen New York, approximately 35 miles south of
                Albany. The cables will follow the river for the majority of the remaining distance to New York City.

            <h3>Astoria Converter Station</h3>
            <p>
                The transmission lines will connect to a new converter station in the Ditmars neighborhood of Astoria.
                <br>Construction of the new facility began in September of 2023, and will eventually convert roughly
                1,250 megawatts of electricity into power for New York City residents and businesses. The coverter
                station is being built on the former site of the oil- and gas-fired Charles Poletti Power Plant, which
                at the time of its closure in 2010 was the worst polluter in the city.

            <h3>Rainey Substation</h3>
            <p>
                The final terminus of the project will be along the East River at the exisiting Rainey Substation.

                The energy carried down the CHPE is expected to be able to power over one million residences in New York
                City, and provide a reliable clean energy source. This electricity can fill gaps in other green energy
                sources such as wind and solar caused by intermitent generation periods.
